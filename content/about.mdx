# About Me
I’m **Sagar Siripuram**, a Sustainability Analyst with a specialist focus on whole-building and product Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Over the past three years I’ve helped manufacturers, architects, and brands translate complex environmental data into clear, actionable strategies—everything from cradle-to-grave carbon footprints to Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for new flooring variants. Before diving into sustainability, I spent two years in core civil-construction, so I speak fluent concrete, steel and embodied carbon.

At **WAP Sustainability**, I lead LCA projects, GHG inventories, Declare Label and PEP ecopassport certifications, and healthy-materials database management—melding rigorous ISO 14040/44 methodology with a practical, solution-driven mindset. Whether I’m running mass-balance calculations in GaBi, updating a PCR-compliant EPD, or automating carbon-accounting workflows, my goal is simple: empower teams to make smarter choices for people, planet and profit.

When I unplug from spreadsheets and modeling software, you’ll find me chasing green horizons—planting trees, hiking forest canopies or scouting out solar-farm installations. I’m an avid traveler, a regional-level soccer player, and an aspiring entrepreneur. Rooted in tradition but always looking ahead, I blend data-driven analysis with a creative spark—and a dash of humor—to help build a more resilient world, one carbon calculation at a time.
